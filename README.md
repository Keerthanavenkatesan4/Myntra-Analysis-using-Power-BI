# Myntra-Analysis-using-Power-BI
The "Myntra Sales Analysis with Power BI" project is dedicated to providing a comprehensive analysis of Myntra's sales data. By harnessing the capabilities of Microsoft Power BI, our project seeks to deliver valuable insights for data-driven decision-making, with the ultimate goal of enhancing Myntra's business performance. We will start by integrating and harmonizing data from diverse sources, including sales databases, spreadsheets, and APIs, creating a unified data repository that forms the basis for our analysis. The data will then undergo rigorous cleaning and transformation using Power Query Editor, ensuring data accuracy and consistency. We'll build a structured data model with well-defined relationships between tables and hierarchies to enable efficient analysis. Our project will calculate and visualize key performance indicators (KPIs), such as total sales revenue, sales growth rate, average order value, and more, tailored to Myntra's business needs. The centerpiece of our project is an interactive dashboard, comprising various components that provide insights into sales trends, product performance, customer behavior, geographic distribution, inventory management, and returns/refunds data. This comprehensive approach will empower Myntra's stakeholders with actionable insights for better decision-making, enabling them to unlock the full potential of their sales data. The outcomes of this project are expected to include a user-friendly, dynamic Power BI dashboard, which will serve as a valuable tool for stakeholders to delve into Myntra's sales performance, make informed decisions, optimize marketing strategies, streamline inventory management, and enhance customer satisfaction through data-driven strategies. This project has the potential to demonstrate the value of data analytics and visualization in the context of e-commerce sales analysis, setting the stage for further data-driven initiatives within the organization.
