# Myntra-Analysis-using-Power-BI
The "Myntra Sales Analysis with Power BI" project aims to analyze and visualize Myntra's sales data for data-driven decision-making. We will integrate and clean data from various sources, create a structured data model, and define key performance metrics. The project will culminate in an interactive Power BI dashboard, offering insights into sales trends, product performance, customer behavior, geography, inventory management, and returns/refunds. The expected outcomes include improved decision-making, optimized marketing, inventory management, and enhanced customer satisfaction. This project showcases the power of data analytics in optimizing Myntra's sales operations.
